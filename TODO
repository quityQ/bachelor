Keep track of progress in a "diary" file, where issues and progress are noted

- create forest analysis
- create a final comparison report includes all models


# Pasquale meeting 17.03.
Limitations of my approach
	All issues I've encountered can be put into the report 

Explain the real life usecase of the models
check comments in molena


Reports
	report 1 (end of april)
	1 page aorund end of april summary of what has been done
	
	report 2 (early may)

Logistic regression --> balance not so an issue
SVM --> might be an issue

data augmentation --> generate fake companies (SMOTE)

# feedback 18.05.
- language-wise, I do not have major points, but I suggest that you proofread your work. You can also use AI tools, as long as you declare it. For instance, on page 9 you write “so that come variance is kept”, and on page 11 “this new dataset is shows”. Other things follow this line.
- In the literature review, I would suggest adding some recent papers. A quick search on Google Scholar shows that there are interesting things to cite in your report.
- Improve captions. A good caption should help the reader grasp the gist of the results, with details left for the main text. For instance, what does the reader see in Figure 1 about the ROC? What do we see in Table 8? What can you say about significance? Please always refer to Tables and Figures with numbers in the main text.
- Try to provide some more (economic) justification to the choice of the thresholds, especially when looking at Altman’s Z. The more justifications you can provide to your modeling choices, the better: they show that you actively looked for the best approach (given the constraints you have with data, time, etc.) and not only passively applied a few models.
- Improve the description of the model selection procedures you followed, especially for a model like the logistic regression, in which it is of paramount importance. Be more explicit about your choices about significance and the rest.
- Pay attention to overfitting, as much as possible. Better discuss the issue.
- Please improve the references. For example, when referencing code and repositories, either put the info in a footnote, and in that case it is sufficient to provide a link with the time stamp, or try to provide the name of the author/company, if you prefer to put the info in the final bibliography. Also, avoid n.d. (you can use the date of retrieval, in case).
- In the parts that are “to do”, try to keep a critical view on your work: what are you happy about? What could be improved? How? How do your results compare with the literature?
