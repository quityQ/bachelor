In order to calculate the altman score properly the market cap is required

Ex. https://companiesmarketcap.com/credit-suisse/marketcap/
gives us the market cap over several years

this seems to be the most straightforward source since all apis are paid so getting historical number of shares + price is difficult

the issue is the name in the URL, as it's not the ticker nor the name of the company, maybe the search can be used by the scraper to find the correct page
