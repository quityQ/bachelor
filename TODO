Keep track of progress in a "diary" file, where issues and progress are noted

Logistic regression
	- follow the analysis in the book to get all results 
	- roc curve 
	- confusion matrix
	
Tree model
	- use smote to create dummy observations (try to get 1:10 ratio or smething)
	- create a tree and check it
	- move on to forest model


# Pasquale meeting 17.03.
Limitations of my approach
	All issues I've encountered can be put into the report 

Explain the real life usecase of the models
check comments in molena

Logistic regression --> balance not so an issue
SVM --> might be an issue

data augmentation --> generate fake companies (SMOTE)
