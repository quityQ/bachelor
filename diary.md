Attempting to create a scraper for companies-marketcap. Issue is that the URL has the company name in a random format. I believe my best bet is to use the search function of the site to find the page I want to scrape, because searching for the ticker of a company does return the company.
I tried some methods to scrape the search results using the lists I already have for the payload, but the results are too random for me to work with.
I decide to invest the time to manually extend my list of companies with the marketcap url, then I can scrape the data
